This is a recipe sharing social media. Users will be able to share personal recipes, create new recipes using AI, and follow other chefs. The website will allow users to generate new recipes based off of a list of ingredients they have and ingredients they would like to leave out. All recipe images shared on the site will be AI generated and stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
